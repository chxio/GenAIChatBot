Generative AI chatbots are advanced chatbot systems that utilize deep learning techniques, particularly transformer-based models like GPT, to generate human-like responses. 
They are trained on vast amounts of data and learn patterns to produce contextually relevant replies to user inputs. 
These chatbots can engage in more natural and dynamic conversations, making them valuable for various applications such as customer support, language translation, 
and creative writing. However, they require significant computational resources and data for training and may sometimes produce unpredictable or incorrect responses. 
Despite their challenges, generative AI chatbots offer great potential for enhancing user interactions and understanding natural language.
